          <p class="lead">I am currently working on my Ph.D. at Harvard University where I am studying Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering on full scholarship from the university (in addition to being a Pierce Fellow, Winston Chen Fellow, Kao Fellow, and Dudley Fellow). The topic of my thesis is bio-inspired design for mechanical and biomechanical applications. In addition, I have completed a master's degree in Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering at Harvard. Before attending Harvard, I completed my Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering at Northwestern University. While at Northwestern, in addition to the research that I did throughout the school year in the Neuroscience and Robotics Laboratory and the Solid Mechanics/Computational Laboratory, I was the Co-Founder and Vice President of the newly formed Northwestern University Chapter of Engineers Without Borders.
          <br /><br />
          During my time at Northwestern, I also was a member of the National Honorary Fraternity for Engineers, Tau Beta Pi, and Northwestern’s Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Advisory Board, all while still maintaining a 3.99/4.00 GPA (graduated #1 in the School of Engineering and Applied Science). In my spare time, I enjoyed playing intramural football, basketball, and softball.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout my studies at Harvard and Northwestern and my internships, I have become proficient in many types of CAD, including SolidWorks, Pro/ENGINEER, and Unigraphics NX. I have also learned basic coding in various programming languages, including Java, Python, and Matlab.</p>

          <p class="lead">While doing my Ph.D. at Harvard in the Bertoldi Lab, I have worked on various research projects, much of which has been published and can be found on my CV. My thesis topic is bio-inspired design for mechanical and biomechanical applications. While carrying out my thesis, my research has involved a variety of topics, from buckling analyses to shark-inspired design for improved aerodynamics to octopus-inspired soft robotics. My shark-inspired engineering work was published with the Royal Society of London and can be found in the link below. After being interviewed by National Geographic, Newsweek, and Physics World about the research, the following articles were published further discussing the work.</p>

          We developed a software program that allows a user to monitor a nuclear plant from a remote lab.
          Using data from sensors that are located on different components of a nuclear plant,
          the software program monitors the plant with codes that diagnose any problems with the plant based on the sensor data.
          It then displays these problems on a graphical user interface so that a person can oversee the nuclear plant from a remote location.</p>

          Essentially, these models help to drastically decrease simulation time, compared to previous direct numerical simulations, when deriving relationships between the microstructure of the filled elastomers and their damping properties.
          </br></br>In addition, I worked on nickel titanium shape memory alloys to help predict microstructural changes to these alloys to improve their ultra high cycle fatigue life.</p>

          2. How forces exerted by a user are a function of the actual and perceived height of a bump on the surface.</p>

          <p class="lead">I worked at Motorola Mobility when the Droid Razr cell phone was being developed. This gave me the opportunity to perform failure analysis and redesign for the volume and power buttons of the Droid Razr. In addition, I gathered and analyzed data on the performance of their new battery design, which did not have a hard casing in order to slim down the battery and ultimately the phone. If the the phone ever needed to be disassembled for repair, the battery deformed when removed from the circuit board because this type of battery did not have a hard casing. This gave me a chance to work as a part of a failure analysis project to quantify the extent of battery deformation upon removal. The data I gathered was presented to chemical engineers with whom a team, which included myself, worked to determine at what point a battery was no longer reusable based on the deformation. This data affected the design of the phone itself and prescribed a suggested process of battery removal in order to avoid damage that prevented the reuse of the battery.</p>
